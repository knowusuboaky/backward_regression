## Backward Regression Python Library - Automated feature selection in linear and logistic regression models.

The Backward Regression Python Library is an open-source toolkit for automated feature selection in regression models. It supports both linear and logistic regression, dynamically selecting the appropriate method based on the target variable.

```python
## installation
pip install backwardsreg
```

```python
## Load Package
from backwardsreg.backward_regression import backward_regression
```

Key Features:
- Automated backward regression for linear and logistic regression models.
- Inclusion and exclusion of features based on user-defined significance thresholds.
- Optional inclusion of interaction terms for enhanced model complexity.

This library is suitable for data scientists, researchers, and practitioners working with regression problems who seek a streamlined approach to feature selection. The library intelligently adapts to the nature of the target variable, supporting both linear and logistic regression models.
